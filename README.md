I'm Gabriel Ganzer (he/him/his), a computer engineer born in 1995 who lives in S√£o Paulo, Brazil.

I've been working as an **embedded system developer** for 3+ years, particularly with System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures and energy-efficient hardware/software design. I've been developing a keen interest in **testing and fault tolerance** that led me to get involved with my current research over the IEEE 1149.8.1-2012 standard for Boundary-Scan-Based Stimulus of Interconnections to Passive and/or Active Components in a project related to **cybersecurity**.

During my spare time, I like to practice Yoga, cook delicious meals, travel (on hold with the COVID-19 pandemic), and advocate for LGBTQ+ people! üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà
