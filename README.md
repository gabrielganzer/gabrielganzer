I'm Gabriel Ganzer (he/him/his), a computer engineer from Campinas, Brazil. Currently, I hold the position of **Embedded Software Developer** at Kryptus EED S.A. developing secure software for **integrated avionic systems**. I'm also experienced with **firmware development** for System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures and energy-efficiency **hardware design**.

During my spare time, I like to practice Yoga, cook delicious meals, travel (on hold with the COVID-19 pandemic), and advocate for LGBTQ+ people! 🏳️‍🌈
