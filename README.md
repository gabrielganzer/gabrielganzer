I'm Gabriel Ganzer (he/him/his), a computer engineer from São Paulo, Brazil. Currently, I'm a **Software Developer** at Kryptus EED S.A. working with machine learning algorithms and MLOps.

During my spare time, I like to practice Yoga, cook delicious meals, travel, and advocate for LGBTQ+ people! 🏳️‍🌈
